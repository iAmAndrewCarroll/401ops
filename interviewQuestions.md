  - **HTTP Status Codes:** Provides feedback on the outcome of the HTTP request.

#### HTTP Request-Response Cycle

Understanding the HTTP request-response cycle is crucial for web application security, detailing how clients and servers exchange data.

1. **Client Sends Request:** Initiates the cycle with a request to the server.
2. **Server Processes Request:** The server processes the incoming request.
3. **Server Sends Response:** The server responds back to the client.
4. **Client Receives Response:** The client receives and, typically, displays the response.

#### Common HTTP Request Methods

| Method | Description                                      |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | Requests data from a specified resource.         |
| POST   | Submits data to be processed to a resource.      |
| PUT    | Updates a specified resource with new data.      |
| DELETE | Deletes the specified resource.                  |

#### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Description                                      |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | OK - The request was successful.                 |
| 404  | Not Found - The resource was not found.          |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - A server error occurred. |
| 403  | Forbidden - Request is understood but refused.   |

## Governance and Compliance

### CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. It stands for:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
- **Integrity:** Assuring the accuracy and reliability of data and information, ensuring it's not altered by unauthorized individuals.
- **Availability:** Ensuring that authorized users have access to the data and resources when needed.

### Risk Analysis
Risk analysis involves identifying potential threats to an organization's information and information systems and determining the likelihood and impact of these threats. It can be divided into two main types:

- **Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Uses subjective judgment based on non-quantifiable information, such as the severity of the impact or the probability of occurrence.
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis:** Involves the use of quantifiable metrics to assess risk, including potential financial costs.

### Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures are essential for establishing a security framework within an organization. They include:

- **Policies:** Broad statements that provide guidance and principles for decision-making.
- **Procedures:** Detailed steps that must be followed to adhere to the policies.

### Reporting
Reporting in governance and compliance refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and distributing security-related information within an organization. It includes incident reports, audit findings, and compliance reports.

### Compliance
Compliance involves adhering to laws, regulations, and guidelines relevant to an organization's operations. This includes industry-specific regulations like PCI-DSS for payment card data, HIPAA for healthcare information, and GDPR for data protection and privacy in the European Union.

### Auditing
Auditing is the process of evaluating an organization's adherence to regulatory compliance, policies, and procedures. Audits can be internal or external and are essential for identifying non-compliance and areas for improvement.

## Advanced Security Topics

### Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying potential threats to a system, including the motivations and capabilities of adversaries, and determining the likelihood and impact of these threats. It involves the identification of valuable assets, the software and system architecture, the identification of potential threats, and the implementation of measures to mitigate these threats.

### Cyber Kill Chain
The Cyber Kill Chain framework, developed by Lockheed Martin, describes the stages of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to actions on objectives. Understanding these stages helps organizations to better defend against attacks:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the target before the attack.
2. **Weaponization:** Creating malware designed to exploit the target.
3. **Delivery:** Transmitting the malware to the target.
4. **Exploitation:** Executing the malware on the target system.
5. **Installation:** Installing a backdoor for persistent access.
6. **Command and Control (C2):** Establishing a channel to control the compromised system.
7. **Actions on Objectives:** Executing the actual objective of the attack.

### Threat Hunting
Threat hunting is a proactive security search through networks, endpoints, and datasets to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. This involves understanding normal baselines and seeking anomalies that could indicate a threat.

### Digital Forensics
Digital forensics involves the investigation of digital devices to preserve, identify, extract, and document computer evidence. This evidence can be used in the prosecution of cybercrime. The process includes securing the scene, collecting evidence, analysis, and reporting.

### Network Analysis
Network analysis involves monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect anomalies, optimize performance, and identify security threats. Tools for network analysis include packet sniffers, network mappers, and flow data analyzers.

### Penetration Testing
Penetration testing (pentesting) is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is used to identify weaknesses (including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access) as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

| Stage                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planning and Reconnaissance| Define the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used. |
| Scanning                  | Understand how the target application will respond to various intrusion attempts. |
| Gaining Access            | Web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and backdoors. |
| Maintaining Access        | To see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system. |
| Analysis                  | Compiling the results of the penetration test and making recommendations for security improvements. |

This comprehensive expansion into governance, compliance, and advanced security topics outlines the critical areas necessary for maintaining and enhancing an organization's security posture.
