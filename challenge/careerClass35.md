## Career Class 35: Mock Interview Workshop

The mock interview workshop was an eye-opening experience! My personal introduction and responses to behavioral questions felt smooth and confident, showcasing the preparation I'd put in. The STAR method truly proved its worth in highlighting relevant skills and experiences. However, the technical questions presented a healthy challenge. While I effectively used problem clarification to understand the core issue, I recognize I could delve deeper into technical details and demonstrate stronger solutions.

This workshop solidified the importance of both soft and technical skills in cybersecurity interviews. I'm confident that by addressing the areas identified here and actively practicing, I'll be well-equipped to ace future interviews!
