# Main Differences between Computer Forensics and Cybersecurity:

**1. What are the main differences between computer forensics and cybersecurity?**
- **Focus**:
   - Computer forensics focuses on uncovering digital evidence from devices and systems for legal purposes or data recovery.
   - Cybersecurity focuses on preventing and mitigating cyber threats by implementing security measures and protocols.
- **Objectives**:
   - Computer forensics aims to gather evidence of digital crimes, analyze incidents, and present findings in legal proceedings.
   - Cybersecurity aims to protect systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, breaches, and attacks.
- **Activities**:
   - Computer forensics involves analyzing digital artifacts, recovering deleted files, and reconstructing digital events to understand past activities.
   - Cybersecurity involves implementing security measures such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to prevent and detect cyber threats.
- **Timeliness**:
   - Computer forensics often operates after an incident has occurred, focusing on investigating and analyzing past events.
   - Cybersecurity operates in real-time, continuously monitoring and responding to potential threats to prevent security breaches.
- **Legal Implications**:
   - Computer forensics involves handling evidence in a manner that adheres to legal standards, ensuring the admissibility of findings in court.
   - Cybersecurity focuses on compliance with regulations and standards to protect systems and data from legal and regulatory consequences.
- **Skill Sets**:
   - Computer forensics requires skills in data analysis, evidence handling, and legal procedures.
   - Cybersecurity requires skills in risk assessment, network security, cryptography, and incident response.

# Six Stages of a Computer Forensics Examination:

**2. What are the six stages of a computer forensics examination?**
1. **Identification**:
   - Identify the scope of the investigation, including the devices, systems, and data sources to be examined.
2. **Preservation**:
   - Preserve the integrity of digital evidence by ensuring it remains unchanged throughout the investigation process. This involves creating a forensic copy of the original data to work with, ensuring the original remains intact.
3. **Collection**:
   - Collect relevant digital evidence, including files, metadata, logs, and system images, using forensically sound methods to maintain the chain of custody and admissibility in court.
4. **Examination**:
   - Analyze the collected evidence to uncover relevant information, such as user activities, file access, timestamps, and system configurations. This may involve using forensic tools and techniques to extract and interpret data.
5. **Analysis**:
   - Interpret the findings from the examination stage to reconstruct digital events, identify patterns, and determine the significance of the evidence in relation to the investigation's objectives.
6. **Presentation**:
   - Present the findings of the computer forensics examination in a clear and understandable manner, often in the form of reports, affidavits, or expert testimony, to support legal proceedings or organizational decision-making.
