[Resource: A Beginner's Guide to the STRIDE Security Threat Model](https://www.ockam.io/blog/introduction_to_STRIDE_security_model)

**1. Explain threat modeling using a scarier real-world non-technical example:**
- Imagine securing a home against potential break-ins in a high-crime neighborhood. You'd identify risks like forced entry or vandalism, then take steps like installing advanced security systems, reinforcing doors, and coordinating with local law enforcement to mitigate these threats.

**2. What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling?**
- **What are we working on?** This involves defining the scope of the project or system.
- **What can go wrong?** Identifying potential threats or vulnerabilities.
- **What are we going to do about it?** Determining actions or countermeasures to mitigate identified threats.
- **Did we do a good job?** Evaluating the effectiveness of the threat modeling process and the implemented measures.

**3. Explaining the benefits of Threat Modeling to a project team:**
- Threat Modeling is like a security roadmap for our application, allowing us to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities early. This proactive approach enhances the application's security, reduces future costs and efforts in fixing issues, and builds user trust in our product.
