**1. How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?**
- I would recommend pursuing SOC 2 compliance to my future company by highlighting the following points:
  - It enhances overall security, mitigating potential risks and ensuring the protection of customer data.
  - SOC 2 certification instills trust in customers, making it easier to do business with enterprise clients who often require it.
  - Early preparation for SOC 2 sets a solid foundation for long-term security and compliance, reducing the risk of security incidents.

**2. What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?**
- The five SOC 2 Trust Principles are:
  - Security: Ensuring the organization's systems are secure and protected from unauthorized access.
  - Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure.
  - Availability: Ensuring systems and data are available as agreed or required.
  - Integrity: Preventing unauthorized changes to systems or data.
  - Privacy: Protecting the use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information.

**3. How would you explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?**
- Think of the SOC 2 pyramid as a house-building project:
  - The base, Policies and Procedures, is like having architectural blueprints, detailing how the house should be built. Without them, chaos ensues.
  - The middle layer, Standard Tools and Documentation, is like having the right tools and materials for construction, making the process smoother and efficient.
  - The top, Day-to-Day Implementation, is the actual construction work. It's where you put those tools and plans into action, ensuring the house is built as per the blueprints.
  
  So, in SOC 2 compliance, Policies and Procedures set the rules, Standard Tools and Documentation provide the means, and Day-to-Day Implementation is where everything comes together to ensure security and compliance.
