**1. How would you explain your role as a Cyber Threat Analyst to a family member?**
- As a Cyber Threat Analyst, my job is like being a digital detective. I work to protect our company's computer networks from cyberattacks. This means I constantly monitor our systems, looking for any signs of unauthorized access or potential threats. If I find anything suspicious, I investigate and help put measures in place to prevent any harm to our organizationâ€™s data and systems.

**2. What makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector?**
- PowerShell is a powerful tool built into Windows that allows system administrators to automate and manage tasks across the operating system. Because of its deep integration with Windows and ability to access many parts of the system, it's an attractive tool for hackers. Attackers can use PowerShell to execute malicious commands and scripts, often bypassing traditional security measures because PowerShell is a trusted tool within the Windows environment.

**3. What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?**
- **Enable Logging and Monitoring**: One key step is to enable detailed logging of PowerShell activities. This includes module logging, script block logging, and transcription. These logs can help detect and analyze unauthorized or suspicious PowerShell activities, making it easier to spot and investigate potential attacks.
- **Behavior Monitoring and Training**: Implement behavior monitoring tools to detect unusual activities associated with malware. Educating the IT team and other employees about the signs of PowerShell-based attacks can also be crucial. This collective vigilance helps in early detection and response to any malicious activities.
