[Resource: SQRLL Archive - Sqrrl was a threat hunting platform vendor with an unusually strong focus on teaching the cybersecurity community about threat hunting best practices. They published some of what are still foundational documents about threat hunting.](https://www.threathunting.net/sqrrl-archive)

**1. How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?**
- **Nature of Activities**: Pentesting, or penetration testing, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. It's a deliberate and planned effort to breach the security of the system using various tools and techniques. Threat hunting, on the other hand, is an ongoing process where security teams proactively search for hidden threats that evade existing security measures.
- **Objective**: The primary objective of pentesting is to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Threat hunting aims to find active, but hidden threats within an organization's network that have bypassed existing security measures.
- **Frequency and Approach**: Pentesting is typically conducted periodically (like annually or semi-annually) and follows a structured approach, often based on known vulnerability databases and attack patterns. Threat hunting is a continuous and more fluid process, relying heavily on the intuition, experience, and hypothesis-driven investigation of the security team.

**2. What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?**
- The primary objective of threat hunting is to proactively identify and mitigate hidden cyber threats that have managed to infiltrate an organization's network without being detected by existing security defenses. This involves continuously searching, identifying, and understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of potential attackers within the network.

**3. Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?**
1. **Highlight the Gaps in Current Security**: 
   - Emphasize that even with a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC), there are advanced threats that can evade traditional security measures. Explain how threat hunting can fill these gaps by actively seeking out these sophisticated threats.
2. **Present Real-World Examples**: 
   - Share case studies or incidents where organizations benefited from threat hunting in identifying and mitigating threats that were not caught by their SOCs. This demonstrates the practical value of threat hunting.
3. **Focus on Proactivity**: 
   - Stress the importance of shifting from a reactive to a proactive security posture. Threat hunting allows the organization to stay ahead of threats rather than just responding to them.
4. **Discuss Return on Investment**: 
   - Illustrate how threat hunting can save the organization from potential massive losses due to undetected breaches. Early detection and mitigation can significantly reduce the cost and impact of security incidents.
5. **Propose a Pilot Program**: 
   - Suggest starting with a small-scale pilot threat hunting program. This allows the organization to see the benefits with minimal investment and can serve as a proof of concept for a more extensive implementation.
