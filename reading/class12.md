**1. What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?**
   - SOCs perform several tasks, including:
     - Providing proactive surveillance of networks and systems to detect and respond to security incidents.
     - Analyzing security trends and vulnerabilities to prevent future breaches.
     - Enforcing security policies, procedures, and compliance measures.

**2. Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.**
   - A SIEM solution is like a super detective for the SOC. It collects data from various sources in your network, like a security camera capturing everything happening. Then, it helps the SOC team by sorting through this data really quickly.
   - Imagine it's like finding a needle in a haystack. SIEM not only finds the needle but also tells the SOC team if the needle is doing something suspicious. It's like a security radar for your network, making sure everything is safe.

**3. How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk?**
   - The typical SOC team structure has different levels, somewhat similar to an IT Help Desk:
     - Level 1 in the SOC is like the first responders, just like the first point of contact in an IT Help Desk who handle basic issues.
     - Level 2 SOC analysts dive deeper into security problems, similar to IT specialists in an IT Help Desk who handle more complex IT issues.
     - Level 3 SOC professionals are like the senior experts in the SOC, much like senior IT specialists who deal with advanced technical challenges.
     - Finally, Level 4 in the SOC is like the management overseeing everything, similar to IT Help Desk managers who manage the entire support team.
