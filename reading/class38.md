# Reading 38: Attacking a Juice Shop with Burp Suite

[Resource: What is Burp Suite?](https://www.technipages.com/what-is-burp-suite/)

**1. Explain how Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic.**
- Burp Suite allows us to analyze web application traffic by acting as a proxy that intercepts web requests and responses. It reads and edits them in real-time before they reach their destinations. This interception capability enables testers to observe and modify the traffic, allowing them to identify vulnerabilities and test how the web application reacts to various inputs.

**2. What does the Repeater tool allow us to do with requests?**
- The Repeater tool in Burp Suite allows us to make manual modifications to web requests and view the corresponding responses side by side. This enables testers to fine-tune exploit attempts by adjusting parameters and payloads, helping them understand the effectiveness of their attacks.

**3. Why might this be a useful tool for an attacker?**
- The Repeater tool's ability to make manual modifications to requests and view responses in real-time is useful for attackers because it allows them to iteratively refine their attack strategies. By observing how the target application responds to different inputs, attackers can tailor their exploits to maximize their chances of success. Additionally, the tool provides immediate feedback, enabling attackers to quickly iterate and adapt their tactics during the attack process.

# SQL Injection Commands for Burp Suite Repeater Attacks

Below are examples of SQL injection commands that can be used in conjunction with Burp Suite Repeater for SQL injection attacks:

1. **Basic SQL Injection**: 
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 --
   ```
   This command typically returns all records from the database by bypassing the login authentication.

2. **Union-based SQL Injection**:
   ```
   ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
   ```
   This command exploits the UNION SQL operator to retrieve sensitive information like usernames and passwords from the database.

3. **Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection**:
   ```
   ' OR (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables) > 0 --
   ```
   This command checks if the condition is true, indicating a successful injection, without displaying any data directly.

4. **Time-based Blind SQL Injection**:
   ```
   ' OR SLEEP(5) --
   ```
   This command causes a delay in the response if the injection is successful, indicating vulnerability through time-based analysis.

5. **Error-based SQL Injection**:
   ```
   ' OR 1=1 AND (SELECT 1/0) --
   ```
   This command triggers an error in the SQL query, revealing database information in the error message.

Ensure to use these commands responsibly and only on systems where you have permission to test for vulnerabilities.
