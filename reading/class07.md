# Read 7: Protecting Data at Rest with Device Encryption

[Resource: Data Protection: Data In Transit vs. Data At Rest](https://www.digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

**1. What is data at rest and data in transit in computer use?**
- Data at rest refers to data that is stationary and stored on a device or network, such as files on a hard drive or stored in a database.
- Data in transit, on the other hand, is data actively moving from one location to another, typically over a network, such as when you send an email or stream a video.

**2. How does data encryption relate to the CIA Triad of information security?**
- Data encryption is closely related to the CIA Triad, which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- Regarding confidentiality, encryption ensures that data is transformed into an unreadable format, protecting it from unauthorized access whether it's in transit or at rest.
- Encryption also contributes to integrity by detecting unauthorized changes to data, as decryption would fail if data is tampered with during transmission or storage.
- While not its primary focus, encryption indirectly impacts availability by preventing data breaches that could disrupt services or data access.

**3. Give examples of data at rest and data in transit in everyday computer usage.**
- Examples of data at rest include files stored on a laptop's hard drive, videos saved on a mobile device, and records stored in corporate HR applications.
- Data in transit examples include sending an email attachment, streaming a video from the internet, and uploading documents to a cloud storage service.
