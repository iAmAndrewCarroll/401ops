# Reading 17: Cloud Network Security

[Resource: IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc)

**1. What are some of the key features of the VPC model?**
- *Agility*: VPCs offer the flexibility to control virtual network size and dynamically deploy cloud resources based on business needs.
- *Availability*: They provide redundancy and highly fault-tolerant availability zone architectures for high application and workload availability.
- *Security*: VPCs ensure logical isolation from other public cloud tenants, allowing control over resource access, enhancing data security and privacy.
- *Affordability*: VPC customers can leverage cost-effectiveness by reducing hardware costs and other expenses through public cloud resources.

**2. What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?**
- The three tiers in the three-tier architecture model are:
  - *Web or Presentation Tier*: This tier manages user interactions, handling requests from web browsers and presenting information to end-users, focusing on the user interface.
  - *Application Tier*: Housing business logic, the application tier processes most operations. It handles requests from the presentation tier and interacts with the database tier.
  - *Database Tier*: Comprising database servers, this tier stores and manages data processed in the application tier, facilitating data storage and retrieval.

**3. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.**
- *VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)*: Think of a VPC as having your own private condominium within a large apartment complex. It's a secure, private space within a shared environment. Only you have the key, and it's isolated from other apartments. It's akin to owning a private island within a resort where only you and your guests have access.
- *VPN (Virtual Private Network)*: Now, picture a VPN as a secret underground tunnel connecting your home to your workplace. It ensures that no one else can see what you're sending between home and work. It's like having a private road exclusively for you and your colleagues to securely share information.
