**1. Measures for CIA Triad in a Bank ATM:**
- **Confidentiality:** 
  - Use secure PIN entry methods to protect user access.
  - Encrypt data transmission between ATM and bank server.
  - Implement access control to restrict unauthorized physical access to the ATM components.

- **Integrity:**
  - Employ secure protocols to verify the authenticity of data received.
  - Implement data checksums or digital signatures to detect any unauthorized modifications.
  - Regularly update software and firmware to address vulnerabilities.

- **Availability:**
  - Ensure redundant power sources to prevent downtime due to power failures.
  - Implement a monitoring system to detect and respond to hardware or software failures promptly.
  - Regularly perform maintenance to prevent hardware failures and optimize system performance.

**2. Three Best Practices for CIA Triad:**
- **Least Privilege:** Grant users the minimum level of access or permissions required to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access and maintains confidentiality.

- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data during transmission and storage to protect confidentiality and integrity. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains secure.

- **Regular Backups:** Performing regular data backups helps maintain availability. In case of data loss or system failures, backups ensure that critical data can be restored, preserving availability and integrity.

**3. Three Stages of Risk Management Lifecycle:**
- **Risk Assessment:**
  - **Main Goal/Objective:** Identify and assess risks by categorizing assets, identifying threats and vulnerabilities, and evaluating their potential impact. The objective is to understand the risk landscape.

- **Risk Analysis:**
  - **Main Goal/Objective:** Analyze risks using qualitative and quantitative methods. This stage assigns values to risks, such as their likelihood and potential impact. The objective is to prioritize risks for mitigation.

- **Risk Mitigation/Response:**
  - **Main Goal/Objective:** Develop and implement strategies to mitigate or respond to identified risks. This stage involves reducing, transferring, accepting, or avoiding risks. The objective is to minimize the impact and likelihood of risks.

These stages collectively help organizations make informed decisions about how to manage and address risks effectively.
