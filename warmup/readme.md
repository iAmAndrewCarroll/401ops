### Python Script Explanation

1. Initialize empty lists for each status: `warnings`, `threats`, and `errors`.

2. Open the 'raw.txt' file for reading using the `with` statement and store its contents in the `lines` variable as a list of lines.

3. Iterate through each line in the `lines` list:

   - Check if the line contains the word "WARNING." If it does, append it to the `warnings` list.
   - Check if the line contains the word "THREAT." If it does, append it to the `threats` list.
   - Check if the line contains the word "ERROR." If it does, append it to the `errors` list.

4. After categorizing all the lines, open three separate .txt files ('warnings.txt', 'threats.txt', 'errors.txt') for writing using the `with` statement.

5. Write the contents of the `warnings` list to 'warnings.txt', the contents of the `threats` list to 'threats.txt', and the contents of the `errors` list to 'errors.txt'. This separates the data into three different files based on their status.

6. Print a message to indicate that the files 'warnings.txt', 'threats.txt', and 'errors.txt' have been created with the respective data.

The script reads data from 'raw.txt', categorizes each line based on whether it contains "WARNING," "THREAT," or "ERROR," and then writes these categorized lines into three separate output files. This way, you get three separate .txt files with data organized by status.
